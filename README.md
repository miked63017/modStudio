This is a tool I made to aid in the process of making mods for Android phones. I was tired of having multiple tools in different places and wanted to bring everything together with some easy shortcuts. 

This should work on any 64 bit linux distro at the moment, but I have only tested on OpenSuse 13.1 since that is what I use.

Example usage:

git clone https://github.com/miked63017/modStudio.git
cd modStudio
. tools/toolbox
pullSystemFromPhone
deodex services.jar
